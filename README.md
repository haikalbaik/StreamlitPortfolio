## How it was Built

This portfolio website was built with the assistance of **Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash**. The entire site creation process, from initial scaffolding to styling and feature implementation, was guided and executed through conversational prompts with the Gemini models. This project serves as a demonstration of the capabilities of large language models in accelerating web development and personal branding efforts.
